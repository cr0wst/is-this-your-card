# Is This Your Card?

"Pick a card, any card," the magician prompts you fanning out a deck of cards. You select a card, note its value, and hand it back to the magician. They do some sleight of hand, make the card disappear into the deck, and then make it reappear. You confirm that it is, indeed, your original card. The magician moves on and you get to go back to enjoying your dinner.

Where is the real magic? Is it in the magician's ability to make a card reappear? Or, is it something that many of us take for granted each and every day? In the very instant you glance at a card, you're able to take in details without even thinking about it.

In this lightning talk that I rapidly prepared for RailsConf 2019, I tried to explain in 5 minutes the process of using Canny edge detection to locate a playing card in a webcam feed. This code is the final result.
